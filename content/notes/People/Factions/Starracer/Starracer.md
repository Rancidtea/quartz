The boat in the [[Astral Sea]], crewed by bounty hunters.

The boat doesn't get it's magic from the helm. Heard legends of ships that were so powerful that it takes more than just ahelm to guide them. Seems elven in design. Astral elves aren't the best at making spelljammers, so maybe made a couple then stopped.
