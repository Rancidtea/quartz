An eldritch lord of the [[feywild]] realm and the master of creation. Although not technically a god, their power rivals that of many. 

When the fey realm was created, Yizegeth was amongst the first three creatures made to rule the plane. This also included [[the Stag]], the Son of [[Titania]], and an entity known as [[Eternity]]. All three have yet to reveal their true names to any other beings. 

Each of these beings represented a different, absolute law of the [[Feywild]] and the world in general. While [[the Stag]] represented law and [[Eternity]], fate, Yizegeth represented chaos or in other words, the eternal, ever-changing and incomprehensible nature of the Fey. 

Before being cast away to the depths of the Far Realm, Yizegeth was known by the name Pandemonium. Their true name has been stricken from history, left to be known by only those of ages long before. 

It was their decision to side with [[Asmodeus]], [[Tashar]] and [[Rigdran]], now dubbed this world’s evil gods, during the [[Cataclysm]] that led to them being struck of their title and cast away far out of the reach of the material plane ([[Mjad Djt]]). He is now said to be banished in the [[Far Realm]].

But despite their banishment, they managed to extend their influence to the material plane once more after gaining a following of gith.
