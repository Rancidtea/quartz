The grand creator, the architect of the world and all living creatures. He was destroyed in an ancient event known as the [[Cataclysm]], however most regions and religions have their own interpretations as to what happened. He is also responsible for the ascension of 6 mortals to godhood, which happened shortly after the cataclysm. Although he has been destroyed, there are many who still worship him and can gain power from what little of his essence is still present.
