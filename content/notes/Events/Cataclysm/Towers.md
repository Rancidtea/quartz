Eight towers were erected by the gods in the effort to keep the evil gods from the material plane. While the Allfather succeeded in creating the first two, he was killed (the [[Cataclysm]]) before the other six could be completed. In their completion, the runes inscribed in all eight towers activated, and casted a powerful seal over the world to keep it from the evil gods and great old eldritch horrors.
