During this millennium-long age, mortals saw the rise and fall of deities and powerful lords a-many. It was the climax of this age in which [[the All father]] was slain and the ascension of six mortals took place. The end of the age was one of rebuilding for the world did not heal overnight from this epoch. 

This event was triggered when [[Asmodeus]] and [[Rigdran]] allied forces in an attempt to prevent [[the All father]] from creating the Ascended. They were eventually joined by [[Tashar]], who ascended during the Cataclysm. The meeting of the two gods was orchestrated by [[Tashar]] out of a deep-rooted hatred towards [[the All father]] in denying him the ability to ascend alongside the other six. 

It was a combination of the novel powers of the Ascended, the inherent discourse between the three evil gods and the opposition from existing gods that led to their eventual defeat. Asmodeus was stripped of his physical, material form such that he should never walk amongst the material plane ([[Mjad Djt]]) ever again. Rigdran was banished to the Abyss with a powerful seal. [[Yizegeth]] was forced from the [[Feywild]] into the [[Far Realm]]. [[Tashar]] was stripped of most of his power - residing now as a demi-lich with his cultist following. This was not, however, before the four of these beings had managed to change the world as mortals knew it, destroying the very foundations of material law while destruction laid in their wake. 

While originally, magic was essentially limitless for all those who could access it, [[the Lorekeeper]] altered this feature of arcana to cap the capabilities of mortals harnessing the Weave. 9th level spells became the limit any person could harbour, and to attempt to utilise more power beyond this limit was a near death sentence as said magic became too difficult to possess. 

With this, the chances of another lich ascending themself to godhood without the intervention of a deity could be squandered.
