The southernmost continent. Predominantly covered in temperate forests and large mountain ranges (think the US rocky mountains). Once you far enough south, you reach a frozen region known as the desolate wastes (siberia). The wastes are exceptionally dangerous and full of aggressive giants.(races common to this continent: Goliaths, humans, wood elves, orcs, and dwarves) The countries in Luticah are [[Alpate]] and [[Ranganor]].
