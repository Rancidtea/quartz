## Continents
## [[Luticah]]

The southernmost continent. Predominantly covered in temperate forests and large mountain ranges (think the US rocky mountains). Once you far enough south, you reach a frozen region known as the desolate wastes (siberia). The wastes are exceptionally dangerous and full of aggressive giants.(races common to this continent: Goliaths, humans, wood elves, orcs, and dwarves) 

## [[Salwesh]]

Located north east of Iuticah and only 2 days distant by ship. The entire continent is a mostly subtropical climate, covered in both large rolling hills and several mountain ranges. The continent experiences small seasonal changes and most regions can grow crops year round.(races common to this continent: Humans, High elves, halflings, and gnomes). 

## [[Vokira]]

Located on the equator, but very far to the west of Salwesh and Iuticah. Covered in large deserts and savannas. A humid region on the southern part of the continent is a dense jungle. (races common to this continent: Humans, dragonborn, goblinoids, and many monstrous races). 

## [[Piaphex]]

Very small continent located just north of the equator and east of Salwesh. It has extremely diverse biomes and an abundance of wild magic.(races common to this continent: Drow, Genasi, Gith, and other extraplanar races.)

## [[Priodia]]

The continent located farthest north, was discovered only 200 years ago, the southern coasts are warm and extremely humid. Most of the area northward is sparsely populated and poorly mapped.(races common to this continent: mostly humans, but is the most diverse).
